# Portfolio-Project
For this project, I'll be building a portfolio website. I will be provided a design mockup as a PDF-file, and I must replicate that design in HTML and CSS. I will develop a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects I will complete through the course of your Nanodegree program.

## Instructions
Download the three files (html, css and img) and save them in the same folder.
Open the html file from the browser.
