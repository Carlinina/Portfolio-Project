# Portfolio-Project
For this project, I built a portfolio website. I was provided a PDF-file design mockup, and I replicated that design in HTML and CSS. I developed a responsive website that displays images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects.
## Instructions
1. Download the three files (html, css and img) and save them in the same folder.
2. Open the html file from the browser.
